During a project undertaken as part of my Software Engineering studies during a HyperionDev bootcamp, I was tasked with developing an online CV webpage. This project required the creation of a professional online resume that encompassed a succinct bio, comprehensive work experience, skillset details, and educational background. Additionally, CSS was employed to enhance the visual aesthetics and layout of the webpage, ensuring a polished and professional presentation.
